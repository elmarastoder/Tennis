   Wimbledon is the third grand slam played in the tennis season.
   Wimbledon's full name is The Championships Wimbledon but called 
   Wimbledon instead and is the third of four major tournaments 
   played in the year. Yes, you still have to go through qualifying 
   rounds. Wimbledon is usually played the last week of June and the

  U.S. Open is the fourth and final grand slam played in the
  tennis season. The U.S. Open doesn't really have a different 
  name to be called unless you want to say "Open". It is the 
  final major tournament of the year. I'll say it one more time,
  you do need to go into qualifying rounds. The U.S. Open is usually 
  played the last week of August and the first week of September. Open's
  surface is a hard surface and is held in Flushing, New York.

  <div id="hardsurface" class="collapse">
    Hard surfaces are made of multiple layers like asphalt, concrete, and covered with 
    acrylic material in order to make the lines of a court for players to play tennis on.
    There are only two out of the four grand slams that are played on hard surfaces; 
    the U.S. Open and the Australian Open. There are many outside masters that are played 
    on hard surfaces. This surface is the most commonly played on surface.

  <div id="claysurfaces" class="collapse">
    Clay surfaces are made of either crushed shale, stone, or brick.
    There are two different types of clay courts; red and green clay. 
    Red is flat and the water is balanced while in green clay, it's 
    slanted for a water run-off. Clay courts are usually common in Europe
    and Latin America. The French Open is the only one out of the four 
    grand slams that has a clay surface which make it unique.

      <button type="button2" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#lawntennissurfaces">Lawn Tennis Surfaces</button>
  <div id="lawntennissurfaces" class="collapse">
    Lawn tennis surfaces are made of, you guessed it, grass and very
    packed soil. It's very slippery to play on grass. The ball doesn't 
    bounce above the knee and although the speed is in the ball, the player 
    still has to be quick to play the ball. The only grand slam to have 
    a grass surface is Wimbledon which make it unique to the sport. Lawn tennis 
    is mostly common in England or Europe.
